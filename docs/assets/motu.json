However, he hides them in the palace of a kingdom that he's put under a curse. The king is even under a curse, to make him look ugly. Skeletor tells him that if he doesn't keep them securely hidden and do exactly as he says, he will put the people of his kingdom under the same ugliness curse that he has put the king and the terrain under. To avoid this, the king has reluctantly agreed. Teela must convince him that there are worse things than ugliness and that he must stand up to Skeletor.

The only part Evil-Lyn is supposed to play is to put a glamour over Kobra Khan to make him look like an ordinary Eternian citizen, whom the palace is opened up to today in order for King Randor to hear their grievances, concerns, or requests on how things are going in the kingdom. To make sure that Orko doesn't interfere, Skeletor steals his magic! When Prince Adam finds out about this, they go to the palace to speak to Man-at-Arms. Unfortunately, there is nothing he can do. So, with a time limit set at getting back in time for the event to start, Orko and Prince Adam head out to a magic waterfall that Orko has heard of that is supposed to give him his magic back. However, getting there is the real problem. Man-At-Arms tells viewers that people with different abilities can combine them into an ability greater than the sum of its parts and this can make many jobs much easier."
